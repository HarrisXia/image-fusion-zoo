# image-fusion-zoo

Every week, new image fusion papers are coming out and it's hard to keep track of them all, not to mention the incredibly creative ways in which researchers are naming these methods! So, here's a list of what started as a fun activity compiling all named methods!


**Pixel-level image fusion** - [S. Li, X. Kang, L. Fang, J. Hu, H. Yin, Pixel-level image fusion: a survey of the state
of the art, Inf. Fusion 33 (2017) 100–112.](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S1566-2535(17)30593-6/sbref0002) 
**Multi-focus image fusion** - [Y. Liu, X. Chen, H. Peng, Z. Wang, Multi-focus image fusion with a deep con-
volutional neural network, Inf. Fusion 36 (2017) 191–207.](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S1566-2535(17)30593-6/sbref0006)
